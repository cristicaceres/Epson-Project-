Epson Lab Project



Welcome to our final exam project. After attending lectures and participating in lab meetings, we have been enhancing our coding skills and planning abilities to program an Epson robot arm. Our goal is to complete specific tasks assigned by our professor. The project focuses on two fundamental objectives, each assessed based on completion time. We are engaged in a competition among teams formed by our classmates.
